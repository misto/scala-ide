<!-- 
Compiler plug-ins need to be packaged in a jar, but Eclipse plug-ins aren't jars
during development, so we have to create our own. Note that this jar only holds
the compiler plug-in, all the analyzers are loaded reflectively anyway and thus
don't have to be part of the jar. Also see CodeAnalysisPlugin#getClassLoader.
